# Static Routing Notes

Static routing was implemented to enable communication between the NY and LA networks.

While effective for small networks, static routing does not scale well and requires manual updates as the network grows.

Limitations include:
- Manual route configuration
- Poor scalability
- No automatic failover
- Increased administrative overhead

Future updates may include implementing a dynamic routing protocol such as RIP or OSPF.
